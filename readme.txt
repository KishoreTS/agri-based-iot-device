	--Kishore T S (1851048)

We have implemented the agri based manage system by creating a Python WebServer With Flask and Raspberry Pi.
We used a Raspberry Pi as a local Web Server, where we can control via a simple webpage, where 3 of its GPIOs programmed as outputs and 2 of its GPIOs programmed as inputs.
